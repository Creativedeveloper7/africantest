Or The Maasai Mara Phenomenon, about a Maasai woman who is visited by an other-worldly monolith and must now battle her deity and humanity, an ambitious project you’ve probably never heard of because Likarion is waiting for the right circumstances to tell it. Or Subterranea, Kenya’s first-ever sci-fi series, which he describes as “Big Brother meets Survivor meets Silo.”The Showmax Original series follows eight participants of a psychological experiment who are placed in an underground bunker to test the effects of close-quarter, secluded relationships in humans.

                                                The future of AI in coding is poised to revolutionize the software development landscape. AI-powered tools are already automating code generation, debugging, and optimization, enabling developers to work more efficiently. With advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning, AI can understand and write code based on human instructions, significantly reducing development time. AI-assisted platforms like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI’s Codex are examples of how AI can enhance coding productivity by suggesting code snippets or even completing entire functions.

As AI becomes more integrated into coding, it is expected to handle routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on more creative and complex problem-solving. However, this evolution raises concerns about job displacement, requiring developers to upskill and adapt to new AI-driven workflows. In the future, AI may become a collaborative partner in coding, democratizing software development for non-programmers while enhancing professional developers' capabilities.

                                                <p id="more-text-1" class="hidden">
                                                    In the courtyard of a psychiatric ward at one of Bamako’s largest hospitals, a small group of patients sway to the rhythm of a djembe, a traditional West African drum.

They then begin acting out a scene depicting a village dispute.

One young patient, Mamadou Diarra, shouts in Bambara at another: “Hee hee ha ha ha ha! You don’t know anything! Just nonsense!”

Both burst into laughter, and Diarra continues dancing, tossing playful insults at his fellow actor.

This group is participating in Koteba, a traditional theater form practiced by the Bambara, Mali’s largest ethnic group. Koteba blends acting, singing, and dancing, typically performed in villages as a way to address conflicts and provide an open space for satire.

At Point G, one of Bamako’s major hospitals, Koteba offers a sense of community and support to those receiving psychiatric care.

The tradition was introduced to the psychiatric ward in 1983 by a troupe of actors, and since then, patients and performers have gathered every Friday for their sessions.

Diarra, the star of today’s performance, is surrounded by other patients.

“I’ve never acted or danced before,” Diarra shares. “But once I started, it’s like God gave me the talent.”

He adds, “You know what my issue is? I see things exactly as they are.”

In response, Adama Bagayoko, the leader of the troupe, reassures him, “We’ll help lighten that burden for you.”

With fewer than 50 mental health professionals in Mali serving a population of over 20 million, according to a 2022 WHO report, many people with mental illnesses go untreated and face social isolation.

Bagayoko, 67, was one of the original actors who brought Koteba to Point G, as mental health professionals sought culturally relevant ways to support patients.

“Koteba is essential because it gives these patients a voice,” Bagayoko says. “When they see through Koteba that they are not excluded, it empowers them. We touch, talk, dance, and laugh together. Touch shows equality, and listening proves that their words matter."

The Koteba sessions at Point G follow a structured routine. The performers first play music to gather patients into the courtyard. Next, they discuss the theme of the day’s performance. Afterward, they sit in a circle, giving any patient the opportunity to speak.

Souleymane Coulibaly, a clinical psychologist at Point G, believes Koteba’s traditional roots make it a valuable tool in helping patients process their struggles.

“Koteba is a Bambara tradition that addresses social issues, often heavy ones, with the goal of relieving that weight,” he explains.

Feeling at ease during the sessions, patients frequently open up to the actors, sharing personal stories they might withhold from their families or doctors.

In one performance, patients reenact a familiar scene in Mali where a man accused of theft flees his village as angry neighbors confront him.

Point G hospital sits close to Mali’s political hub—just a short distance from the presidential palace and a key military base, both central to the nation’s 2020 military coup, which exacerbated extremist violence and economic difficulties.

Yet, during these Koteba sessions, those larger issues seem far away. For Diarra and his fellow patients, they are fully absorbed in the world they create together.
